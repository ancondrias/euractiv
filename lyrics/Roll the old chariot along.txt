*Traditional sea shanty*

Well a night on shore          |
Wouldn’t do us any harm        | (TER)

And we’ll all hang on behind   |
And we’ll roll the old         |
chariot along                  | (TER)
And we’ll all hang on behind

(De volgende strofen worden op dezelfde manier gezongen.)

Well a nice watch below

Well a nice glass of beer

Well a night with the girls

Well a big pot of gold
